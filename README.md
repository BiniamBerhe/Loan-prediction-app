Key Findings üè¶üí≤üìä:

- Credit scores and co-applicants significantly impact loan approvals.
- Data scaling addresses skewed distribution and zero loan sanctions.
- Income (USD) varies across categories, and balanced correlations exist between gender, income stability, no defaults, and loan sanction amounts. Certain professions and urban locations show higher loan approvals.
- Numeric variables positively correlate with loan sanction, especially more credits and co-applicants. - Little multicollinearity observed; Loan Amount Request and Property Price are reasonably correlated.
- Prioritize predictive features for applicant profiling.

## Business problem

Optimize loan approvals and accurate loan amount estimation using applicant profile details (credit scores, co-applicants). Reduce instances of zero loan sanctions, identify key predictive features for profiling, and understand correlations to optimize loan sanction amounts.

## Data source

- [Kaggle loan amount prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/phileinsophos/predict-loan-amount-data)

## Methods

- Exploratory data analysis
- Multivariate correlation
- Model deployment
- UI Integration using Streamlit

| Model with the best hyperparameter | RMSE (range between 0 and 400000) |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Random Forest                      | 19505.51                          |
| Gradient Boosting                  | 19525.17                          |

- **_The final model used is: Random Forest_**
- **_Metrics used: RMSE_**
- Why choose random forest? while bagging was better in our cross validation result with `RMSE: 95% Confidence Interval: (19342.359, 20763.027) vs Random forest RMSE: 95% Confidence Interval: (19309.774, 20999.564)`, Random forest performed better in our test dataset.

## Recommendations

- Based on the analysis on this project, we found out that the loan amount that will be granted is determined mainly by the loan amount requested, credit score and a co-applicant. The least important features are expenses types and gender.
- Recommendation would be to focus more on the most predictive feature when looking at the applicant profile, and pay less attention on the least predictive features.

## Limitation and Improvement to be made

- The dataset lack a metadata about the features. (What expenses types mean? What does property type 1, 2, 3, 4 mean?)
- Loan Sanction Amount shows a separation between zero and non zero vales, retraining the model with non zero amount showed much better result
- Additional Feature engineering could be done to enhance the dataset
